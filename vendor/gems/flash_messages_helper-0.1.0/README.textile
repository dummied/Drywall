h2. Configuration Points

h3. Changing the default id of the flash elements

By default the id of the flash message element will come through as flash-_error-type_

* flash-error
* flash-notice
* flash-warning
* _ect..._

To change this you can pass set a lambda that will get called with the key of the message type.

<pre># config/initializers/flash_messages_helper_settings.rb
ActionView::Base.flash_message_id_proc = lambda {|key| "#{key}-message"}</pre>

A _error_ message will now displayed with the dom element id of _error-message_ rather then _flash-error_ throughout the application

<pre><div class="error" id="error-message">There was an error!</div></pre>

h3. Changing the default class of the flash elements

By default the class of the flash message element will come through as _error-type_

* error
* notice
* warning
* _ect..._

To change this you can pass set a lambda that will get called with the key of the message type.

<pre># config/initializers/flash_messages_helper_settings.rb
ActionView::Base.flash_message_class_proc = lambda {|key| "#{key} hideable"}</pre>

A _error_ message will now displayed with the dom element class of _error hideable rather then _error_ throughout the application

<pre><div class="error hideable" id="flash-error">There was an error!</div></pre>

h3. Changing the default html tag type of the flash elements

As a default the html tag used to wrap the flash messages is a div element.  This can be easily globally changed with the following setting.

<pre># config/initializers/flash_messages_helper_settings.rb
ActionView::Base.flash_message_tag = :p</pre>

With the above setting flash messages will be wrapped inside of a paragraph tag rather then a div.

<pre><p class="error" id="flash-error">There was an error!</p></pre>
